## üß© Project Overview
This project implements and tests the `FlightSearch` class for the *WorldWanderer* website.  
The goal is to validate user flight search criteria according to eleven specified conditions and recent lecturer clarifications.

### ‚úÖ Implementation Highlights
- Strict date validation using `DateTimeFormatter` and `ResolverStyle.STRICT`
- Validation of allowed airport codes and seating classes
- Passenger totals between **1 and 9**
- Children and infants restricted from emergency rows or certain classes
- **Negative child/infant counts** handled as invalid (clarification update)
- Return date must be on or after departure date
- Only **economy class can have emergency row seating**, but *all classes can be non-emergency* (updated Condition 10 wording)
- Class attributes update **only when validation succeeds** ‚Äî proven via pre/post assertions in tests

---

## üß™ Unit Testing (JUnit 5)
All tests are written with **JUnit 5** and executed using the standalone console launcher.

### Test Coverage
| Group | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Condition 1 | Passenger totals 1‚Äì9  +  negative child/infant counts |
| Condition 2 | Children + emergency / first class restrictions |
| Condition 3 | Infants + emergency / business restrictions |
| Condition 4 | ‚â§ 2 children per adult |
| Condition 5 | ‚â§ 1 infant per adult |
| Condition 6 | Departure date not in past |
| Condition 7 | Strict date format validation |
| Condition 8 | Return ‚â• Departure |
| Condition 9 | Allowed seating classes |
| Condition 10 | Only economy can be emergency row (all classes non-emergency OK) |
| Condition 11 | Valid and distinct airport codes |
| Attribute Proof | Pre/Post validation test verifying class updates only on valid input |

**Total tests:** 34 (successful)
